"""A project-filtered recall searches inside the project, not only filters after.

WHY
---
``project`` narrows the fused candidate pool (``retrieval.project_scope``). The
pool is built without knowing the project, so a project's memory that closer
matches from other projects pushed below the pool was never a candidate: the
filter then fell back to unfiltered results and said "nothing found was saved
under this project", which was untrue, and a strict filter would have returned
nothing although the memory was there. The same defect, and the same remedy,
as kind-filtered recall (``retrieval.kind_scope``).

WHAT THIS DOES
--------------
Before fusion, the meaning and words searches run once more restricted to the
facts of memories saved under that project (``core.project_identity`` decides
what "the same project" means), and their hits are merged into the semantic and
BM25 channel lists (same ids keep their best score). The post-fusion project
filter still runs and still decides what is shown: this only makes sure the
memories it looks for are in front of it.

Members are read fresh for each recall that names a project (one indexed pass
over the profile's memories that carry a project); nothing is cached, so a
memory saved or moved a moment ago counts at once. Personal scope only, like
kind scoping: shared or global memories of other profiles are still found by
the ordinary channels and filtered after fusion. Never raises.
