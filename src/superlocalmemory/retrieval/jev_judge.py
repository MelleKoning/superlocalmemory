"""The hosted answer check: Jev, through TypeSafe or OpenRouter.

Off unless someone chose it, stored a key and accepted that the question and
the top memories leave the machine. One request judges the whole top-k set;
with the optional reordering on (``jev_rerank``), that same one request also
chooses the order of the top results.
A failed request is never retried — it may already have been billed — and,
like every judge, a failure means the recall is reported as before.

Request/response shape confirmed against the public docs (2026-10-02):
``POST <endpoint>`` with ``Authorization: Bearer <key>`` and a JSON body of
``{"model", "state", "questions"}``; a 200 response is
``{"model", "answers", "usage"}`` where each answer echoes its question's
``type``. TypeSafe's quickstart page describes ``state`` as a string, but its
System One concepts page describes it as "a state object plus your
questions", which is what the pinned endpoint/model table in this module
already assumed — this module sends ``state`` as a JSON object, following the
object description and the pinned contract, not the quickstart's looser
wording. A "noul" answer here carries only ``{"type", "noul"}``: unlike
"choice"/"score", TypeSafe does not attach confidence/probabilities to a noul
answer, so neither is required when parsing one.
