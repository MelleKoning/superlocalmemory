"""Narrowing a recall by project, by the agent that saved a memory, or by what
a memory is about.

``project`` and ``agent`` come from what was recorded when each memory was
saved (the ``project`` and ``agent_id`` an agent passes to remember). ``agent``
is compared without regard to case or surrounding spaces; ``project`` by
``core.project_identity.project_key`` (4.1.21, GitHub #150), so a bare name
matches the same project saved as a full path. ``about`` is a name - a
person, a project, a tool - looked up the way recall looks up names: exact
name, alias, or a spelling close enough to merge automatically, read-only.

The candidates were already checked for visibility (a shared or global
memory may belong to another profile), so matching does not re-filter by
profile. ``saved_by``, ``about``, ``kind`` and ``tags`` are hard filters: only
memories that match are kept, even if that leaves none, because the caller
asked for exactly that. ``project`` filters too, but recall falls back to
unfiltered results - and says so - when nothing it found was saved under the
project (``retrieval.project_scope``). ``prefer_project`` never filters; it
only ranks that project's memories higher. Reads only; ``matching_fact_ids``
never raises (a failure keeps nothing rather than everything).

``tags`` (4.1.22 G05): exact label matching, composed with every other facet
as AND. A label's identity is ``core.tag_identity.tag_key`` - Unicode NFC,
trimmed, internal whitespace collapsed, casefolded, punctuation kept - never
a raw string compare, so "Token-Optimization" and "token-optimization " are
the same tag. ``tags_match`` is ``"all"`` (every requested label must be on
the memory - the default) or ``"any"`` (at least one). Stored tags are read
from ``memories.metadata_json -> '$.tags'`` and parsed the same way
regardless of whether that value is a comma-separated string, a string that
is itself a JSON array, or (an MCP caller) a real list -
``core.tag_identity.parse_tag_values`` is the one place that distinction is
handled. Unlike ``kind``, no "richer report" lives in this module - the
richer ``tag_scope`` note/reason the response shows is built once, in
``retrieval.tag_scope``, from the same candidates this module already
admitted.
