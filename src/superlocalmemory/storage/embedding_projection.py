"""Embedding-only reads for the retrieval channels.

WHY THIS EXISTS. Three channels (spreading activation, semantic, Hopfield)
score candidates against the query using nothing but ``fact_id`` and the
embedding.  They used to read those candidates as fully hydrated
``AtomicFact`` objects: ``SELECT *`` plus ``_row_to_fact``, which decodes the
embedding AND the two 768-float Fisher vectors through ``.tolist()`` and four
JSON fields, per row, per recall.  At about 1,800 cross-scope facts that was
1.3 s of every cross-scope recall (GitHub #147), for data nobody read.

The functions here run the SAME predicate as the hydrating readers they stand
in for -- built by the same ``_scope_where`` and ``visible_fact_clause`` calls,
in the same order, with the same ``ORDER BY`` -- and project only
``fact_id, embedding``.  The predicate is the authorization rule, so it must
not drift; tests/test_storage/test_embedding_projection.py asserts both readers
return the same ids in the same order.

Decoding is bit-identical to the hydrating path.  A full-width float32 BLOB is
read with ``np.frombuffer``: the old path went float32 -> Python float ->
float32, which is exact, so the values are the same bits.  Everything else
(legacy JSON text, short test vectors) goes through ``decode_embedding``, the
one codec every reader uses, and then ``np.array(..., float32)`` exactly as the
channels did.

One deliberate behaviour change: a row whose embedding cannot be decoded is
skipped with a warning.  Before, one corrupt cross-scope row raised inside
``_row_to_fact``; spreading activation swallowed that and silently lost EVERY
cross-scope seed, while semantic and Hopfield failed the channel.  Losing one
unreadable row is strictly better than losing the channel.
