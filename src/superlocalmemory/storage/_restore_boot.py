"""The restore itself: run at start-up, before anything opens the store.

Order, and why each step is where it is:

 1. Refuse while anything else can write: another live daemon (pid file or the
    writer lease's recorded holder), or anyone holding the writer lease -- this
    process included. The lease is then HELD for the whole restore, so nothing
    can start writing part-way through. A refusal keeps the request for the
    next start and changes nothing.
 2. Re-verify the copy (checksum from its manifest, SQLite's own check).
 3. Check the disk can hold a staging copy plus safety copies of the live store.
 4. Export, from the live store as it is NOW, everything that changed since the
    copy, and record in the request that writing has begun and where that
    export is. A restore interrupted after this point re-uses that export: the
    store it would compute a new one from may already be the restored one.
 5. Build a staging copy of the snapshot and apply deletions and erasures to
    it -- erased data never reaches the live store, not even for a moment.
 6. Write the staging copy into the live store through the SQLite backup API,
    one transaction, after a safety copy into ``pre-restore/``. Power lost
    during the write leaves the old store intact (the transaction rolls back)
    and the request in place; the next start runs it again.
 7. Record the outcome, then retire the request (``restore-intent.done-<ts>``).
    Outcome first: a crash between the two re-runs the restore (harmless, the
    same copy is written again with another safety copy) instead of losing the
    note that the newer memories still have to be added back.
