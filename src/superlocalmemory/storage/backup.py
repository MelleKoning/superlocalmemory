"""Pre-migration database backup utilities.

Provides a consistent, WAL-safe snapshot of both managed databases before
any schema migration runs. Uses the SQLite backup API rather than a
filesystem copy so that in-flight writers on a live WAL database cannot
produce a torn snapshot.

Snapshots are written as flat files directly in ``snapshots_root``
(default: ``canonical_data_root() / "pre-migration-snapshots"``).
This directory is separate from the ``backups/`` directory managed by
``BackupManager``, so pre-migration snapshots are never subject to
``BackupManager._enforce_retention()`` regardless of how many ordinary
backups accumulate.  The separation is structural — not timing-dependent.

Public API intended for use by the migration runner:
  - _backup_via_sqlite_api(src, dest)
  - _pre_migration_backup(learning_db, memory_db, *, backups_root) -> Path
  - _gc_old_backups(backups_root, keep=2, protect=frozenset()) -> None
  - InsufficientDiskSpaceError

Restoring a pre-migration snapshot
-----------------------------------
Use ``restore_pre_migration_snapshot()`` in this module::

    from pathlib import Path
    from superlocalmemory.storage.backup import restore_pre_migration_snapshot
    from superlocalmemory.infra.data_root import canonical_data_root

    root = canonical_data_root()
    snap = root / "pre-migration-snapshots" / "memory-20260819-120000-pre-migration.db"
    restore_pre_migration_snapshot(snap, root / "memory.db")

It verifies the snapshot is a readable database with content and refuses before
touching the live store if it is not, copies the current live database aside
into ``pre-restore/`` first, and only then writes the snapshot into place.

**Do not use ``BackupManager.restore_backup()`` for these snapshots.** It checks
that the source exists, then takes its own pre-restore backup, which runs
retention across the same directory. Retention can unlink the file being
restored; ``sqlite3.connect`` then recreates that path as an EMPTY database, and
the empty database is copied over the live store — and the call returns ``True``.
The snapshot is left as a zero-byte file under its original name, so a second
attempt also appears to succeed. Reproduced: a 500-fact store became 0 tables
while the call reported success.


Why snapshots live outside ``backups/``
----------------------------------------
``BackupManager._enforce_retention()`` globs only its own ``backup_dir``
(``canonical_data_root() / "backups"``).  Because pre-migration snapshots
are in ``pre-migration-snapshots/`` — a completely different directory — no
retention policy can delete them, regardless of how many ordinary backups
accumulate.  An ordinary ``BackupManager()`` call (without ``backup_dir``
override) will not list or touch these files.  That is intentional.

    """Snapshot the databases about to change as flat files before migration.

    Creates ``{db_stem}-{YYYYMMDD-HHmmss}-pre-migration.db`` files directly
    in ``backups_root`` (no subdirectory). Files are named with a
    ``-pre-migration`` suffix so that the GC glob ``*-pre-migration.db``
    identifies them unambiguously without matching any file produced by
    ``BackupManager``.

    Only the databases named in ``databases`` (``"memory"``, ``"learning"``)
    are copied: an update that changes learning.db alone has no reason to copy
    a memory store of several GB first. Only databases that exist on disk are
    copied; a missing database is silently skipped (first-install scenario
    where learning.db may not exist yet). Before anything is copied, one line
    says what is being copied, how large it is and about how long it takes.

    The ``backups_root`` directory defaults to
    ``canonical_data_root() / "pre-migration-snapshots"`` — a directory
    separate from ``BackupManager``'s ``backups/`` directory.  This
    separation means ``BackupManager._enforce_retention()`` can never
    reach these files regardless of how many routine backups accumulate.

    Args:
        learning_db: Path to the learning-plane database.
        memory_db: Path to the memory database.
        backups_root: Override the canonical snapshots root.  Tests pass a
            tmp_path here to avoid writing to the user's data directory.

    Returns:
        The Path of ``backups_root`` (the directory holding the new flat
        snapshot files).

    Raises:
        InsufficientDiskSpaceError: When the free space on the target
            filesystem is less than 110% of the combined source database sizes.
