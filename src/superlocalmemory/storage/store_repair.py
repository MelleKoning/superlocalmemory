"""One-time repair of two kinds of damage left by builds before 4.1.19.

1. Memories whose text was blanked when they were saved. Earlier builds
   replaced anything that looked like a secret with ``[REDACTED:...]`` -
   including ordinary long paths and links. The original text was kept in the
   memory's ingestion record, and its background enrichment never finished
   because the stored copy no longer matched it. A memory is restored only when
   the stored text is exactly the original with some spans replaced by those
   markers; anything else is left alone and counted.
2. Facts marked "replaced" by an automatic check that was wrong. Builds
   before 4.1.19 marked a fact as replaced when an embedding-geometry check, or
   a local model asked about it, judged a newer fact to contradict it; on a
   real store 0 of 22 sampled marks were genuine, and every marked fact was
   pushed down in every recall. Those marks are undone and the old reason is
   kept in the record. A user's own correction is never touched.
3. Entities that a question created. Asking about an unknown name used to
   create an empty entity for it. One is removed only when nothing in the store
   refers to it.

``plan_repair`` reads and changes nothing. ``apply_repair`` runs in one
transaction, and every write is guarded by the value it expects to replace, so
a row changed in the meantime is skipped, never overwritten.
