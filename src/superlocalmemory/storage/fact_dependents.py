"""Rows keyed by a fact id that no foreign key will remove with the fact.

``ON DELETE CASCADE`` takes the tables that declare it (retention, temporal
validity, access log, polar codes, entity associations, temporal events). These
do not declare one, so every path that deletes a fact has to remove them itself.
Before 4.1.22 ``DatabaseManager.delete_fact`` removed only ``embedding_metadata``
and the graph edges, and four of its callers (enrichment's duplicate drop, the
resurrection undo, the canonical writer, entity erasure) left the rest behind.

What that cost, measured on a real 22k-fact store: 9,237 BM25 token rows for
facts that no longer exist, loaded into the live keyword corpus (it counted
30,090 documents for 22,175 facts); 20 vector-map rows whose vector still
answered nearest-neighbour searches for a deleted memory; 1,290 outcome scores.

Every row removed here is derived from the fact and recomputable; none carries
history. Access history and temporal validity are kept by their own cascades.
The vec0 row itself cannot be removed on this connection (it does not load the
vector extension): once its map and metadata rows are gone it is unreferenced,
and the maintenance sweep removes it (``VectorStore.gc_orphaned_vectors``).
