"""Give back the searchable fact enrichment wrongly took from a memory.

Before 4.1.22, enrichment deleted a memory's own first-queryable fact when it
judged it a near-duplicate of ANOTHER memory's fact (fixed going forward by
``core/receipt_guard.py``). Those memories are still stored but have no fact,
so recall can never find them. This finds them and re-promotes one queryable
fact from the memory's own text, through the same builder the save path uses.

A memory qualifies only with POSITIVE PROOF that enrichment removed its fact,
never because it merely has no fact (a person may have deleted it): its save's
ingestion record names the fact and the consolidation log records that fact as
a near-duplicate, or the save finished with facts that all exist and all
belong to other memories (folded into them). Without proof it is counted as
``unproven`` and untouched. With proof it is still held back — counted, never
repaired — when any of these hold:

* ``erased``     a tombstone, erasure receipt or erase obligation names the
                 memory, its fact or its profile, or the fact is being erased
                 now (``erasure_fence``): an erased memory never comes back;
* ``erasure_after_save``  a person/entity or fact erasure ran in its profile after the
                 save (the text may mention who was erased; review by hand);
* ``changed``    the save record no longer matches the memory (scrubbed, edited,
                 other profile, unfinished), or the text is empty;
* ``refused``    the save path's own admission or ingest gate would refuse it;
* ``withheld``   its own or a sibling's fact (the one it was folded into) is
                 quarantined: withheld text is never published through it.
Siblings count for ``erased`` too: an erased sibling means its near-identical
text was erased. Every check runs again inside the write (``promote``).

Reads ids, states and counts; the text is only handed to the fact builder.
