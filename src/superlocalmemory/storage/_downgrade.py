"""Prepare to go back to an older version, without losing anything.

After an update the store is stamped with its schema version, and an older
build refuses to open a store stamped newer than it understands ("This
installation is too old for this database"). That refusal is what keeps an old
build from silently mis-writing a store it does not understand -- so it is only
lifted when every change since the target version is one the older build can
safely ignore:

  * every migration recorded complete above ``target_schema`` declares
    ``DOWNGRADE_FLOOR <= target_schema``, and
  * no completed migration declares ``BREAKING_VERSION > target_schema``.

Then a verified copy is taken (reason ``pre-downgrade``), both stores are
stamped ``target_schema``, and a marker records who prepared it. While the
marker holds, this build does not stamp the store back up at its next start.

The marker holds only while NO other build has run: it records the exact
``.last_version`` file (content and modification time) seen when it was
written. Any other build that starts rewrites that file, and the next start of
this build then drops the marker and stamps normally -- refusing an old build
again is the safe direction.

THE HOLD SURVIVES RESTARTS OF THIS BUILD, ON PURPOSE (L1-11). Between
"prepare" and "install the older version" the daemon may restart on its own
(login items, a crash, ``ensure_daemon`` from a client). If such a restart
undid the preparation, the older version would then refuse the store and the
person would be stranded on it. Holding is safe: preparation is only allowed
when every change since the target version is one the older build ignores, and
this build keeps writing the same schema. It is undone by Cancel (``slm db
prepare-downgrade --cancel`` or the dashboard), taking effect at the next start,
or by any other version starting. The message says exactly that.
