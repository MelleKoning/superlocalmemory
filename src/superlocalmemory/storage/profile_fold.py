"""Fold a deleted profile's memories into another profile (memory.db side).

WHY
---
Deleting a dashboard profile promises to move its memories to 'default'. It
moved two tables and then deleted the profile row with foreign keys on, so
every table tied to ``profiles`` by ON DELETE CASCADE dropped the moved
memories' keyword tokens, vector rows, entities, edges, temporal rows and
scenes on the spot, and every table without that key (the correction ledger,
entity links, the vectors themselves) stayed filed under a profile that no
longer existed. The text survived; the ways to find, link and correct it did
not.

HOW
---
:func:`fold_profile` runs inside the caller's single memory.db transaction,
before the profile row is deleted. Every table with a ``profile_id`` column is
discovered from the live schema (the GDPR erasure's rule), and each one has a
recorded decision below. A table with no decision stops the fold: a new table
must be classified, never silently left behind (tests/test_server/
test_profile_delete_moves_everything.py checks the table is complete).

DECISIONS
---------
MOVE    the row belongs to a moved memory; its key is a global id (fact,
        memory, entity, edge, case, operation...) so it cannot collide.
MERGE   move, but the table has a unique key that 'default' may already hold
        for the same thing; default's row wins and the duplicate is dropped.
REKEY   move; a caller-supplied idempotency key that 'default' already uses is
        suffixed with ``:folded:<row id>`` so neither row is lost.
VEC     a vector table partitioned by profile: sqlite-vec cannot update a
        partition key, so each vector is deleted and re-inserted, same rowid.
DELETE  per-profile configuration, coordination or derived state that would
        change default's behaviour if inherited (learned patterns, compiled
        blocks, community summaries, mesh state, backup destinations, roles);
        it is rebuilt from the moved memories where it is derived.
KEEP    deliberately still names the deleted profile: immutable receipts and
        audit records of what happened under it, and the ids-only change feed
        that tells cached indexes to drop it.

DECISION TABLE (the code's DECISIONS dict is authoritative; the reason for each
table is recorded there)

        canonical_entities, ccq_audit_log, ccq_consolidated_blocks,

        projection_tombstones, provenance, reembed_next_map, reembed_prev_map,
        scene_fact_members, temporal_events, tool_events, vector_row_map
MERGE   consolidated_summaries, entity_profiles, fact_entity_associations,
        graph_edges, ingestion_log, trust_scores
REKEY   correction_cases, ingestion_operations
VEC     fact_embeddings, reembed_next_vec, reembed_prev_vec, reembed_trash_vec
DELETE  activation_cache, backup_destinations, behavioral_assertions,
        behavioral_patterns, community_summaries, compliance_audit,
        core_memory_blocks, cross_platform_sync_log, entity_communities,
        graph_generation, memory_kind_runs, mesh_events, mesh_locks,
        mesh_messages, mesh_peers, mesh_state, pending_outcomes,
        persona_summary, rbac_memberships, soft_prompt_templates
KEEP    erasure_receipts, fact_search_changes, profiles, write_commits

Canonical entities first MERGE by name (case-insensitive, the resolver's own
rule): a moved entity that default already knows is folded into default's, and
every reference to it -- links, aliases, temporal rows, edges, summaries, the
facts' entity lists, scenes -- is repointed before the rows move.
