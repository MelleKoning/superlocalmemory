"""Owner-only permissions for a secret file, on every platform.

On macOS and Linux a secret is created ``0600`` and that is the whole story.
On Windows the mode bits do nothing: a new file inherits its folder's access
list, which normally lets Administrators and SYSTEM read it and can let more
in. The remote TLS private key and the remote key store were written that way
(audit 4.1.20 L12).

This applies the same protected, owner-only access list the proxy capture file
already uses -- built and checked by the helpers in
``optimize/proxy/capture.py`` -- so there is one Windows ACL policy in the
product, not two.
