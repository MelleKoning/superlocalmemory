"""The user's action wins over a correction only a machine proposed.

Varun's decision (2026-10-06): an explicit delete, replace or edit by the user
or their assistant goes through even when a correction case that SLM itself
proposed, and nobody reviewed, names that fact. That pending case is closed as
"overtaken by a user action": moved, whole and unchanged, to
``correction_cases_overtaken`` with who did what and when (the audit row), and
it can be put back (``restore``) while both of its facts still exist.

Before this, such a case made its facts undeletable forever: the ledger refers
to both facts ``ON DELETE RESTRICT`` and keeps every case. On a real 22k-fact
store 1,692 facts were held only by machine proposals (1,081 cases, all still
``proposed``, none reviewed), and a memory's own facts often proposed to correct
each other.

Who proposed a case is recorded on the case itself: the automatic detectors in
core/store_pipeline.py write ``proposed_by_actor_kind = 'host_attested'`` with
reason ``consolidation_update``, ``consolidation_supersede`` or
``temporal_contradiction``; a person's edit is ``host_authenticated`` with
``direct_content_correction``, and a caller's ``replaces`` is applied at once.
A case counts as machine-proposed only when BOTH say so. A case a person
proposed, or any case already applied (or rejected, or rolled back), protects
exactly as before.
