"""The one door memory text leaves this machine through.

SLM keeps credentials exactly as written; that is part of what it is for. The
boundary is the network. Every HTTP request whose body can carry memory text
(a fact, a query, a summary, entity text, chat context) is built here, and two
rules are applied on the URL the request is actually sent to:

* **Another machine** (a cloud provider, a LAN Ollama, anything that is not
  loopback) never receives a credential. Every string in the body passes
  ``outbound_redaction.for_endpoint``, which replaces each recognised
  credential with ``[redacted]``. A body that cannot be read as JSON is refused
  rather than sent unscreened.
* **This machine** sees the text as written, and is reached directly: an
  environment proxy (``HTTP_PROXY`` and friends) is never used, because a
  proxy would carry the unscreened text to whatever host it runs on.

Redirects are never followed, so the URL screened is the URL that receives
the body. ``tests/test_security/test_outbound_gate_guard.py`` fails the build
when a module outside this one opens an outbound connection that is not on its
reviewed list, so a new exit cannot quietly skip the screen.

``httpx`` is imported lazily: the stdlib-only hooks import this module too.
