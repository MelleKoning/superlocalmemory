"""Which mutations may target a profile other than the daemon's active one.

The canonical writer serves one active profile, but profiles are rows in one
store, and every mutation body already names its profile explicitly. What
keeps a mutation on the active profile is therefore a rule, not a mechanism,
and this module is that rule: a mutation reaches another profile only when its
kind is listed in ``ROUTABLE_MUTATIONS`` and the profile exists.

A kind is listed only together with the route that authorizes the routed
profile for it -- the caller's role on THAT profile, checked before the
profile's existence is revealed. ``replaces`` (POST /remember) and correction
review (/api/corrections) do; nothing else does yet, so a route that forwards a
client's ``profile_id`` into delete, merge, scope or kind by mistake is still
refused by the writer.
