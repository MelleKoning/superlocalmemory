"""Which answer check runs, and the one place it is started, switched and stopped.

The rule this module exists to keep: exactly one answer check runs. Switch on
the hosted one (Jev) and the local one (Laya) does not run; switch on Laya and
Jev does not run. Two at once would mean two models resident, two verdicts
that disagree, and memory text leaving the machine while the person believes
it stays local.

"auto" means Laya only when an install was set up and passed its check (the
dashboard or setup path, ``laya_runtime.detect`` reporting it ready) —
otherwise nothing. A ``laya_mlx`` that merely happens to be importable from
SLM's own environment (``pip install "superlocalmemory[full]"``) does not turn
it on; choosing "laya" by name does. "auto" never means Jev: the question and
the top memories leave the machine only when someone chose that, stored a key
and accepted it.

Weights named by repo id are pinned to the revision the threshold was measured
on; when that revision is not in the cache, the check stays off rather than
load whatever revision happens to be there.

Reordering the results is an option of the hosted check only, with its own
consent (``jev_rerank_k``). Laya is never built to reorder, and "auto" never
reaches the branch that could.

One model per process, not just per engine. The daemon's hot reconfigure
builds the new engine before it closes the old one, so two engines briefly
coexist. Through here they share one Laya worker (and the old engine's close
does not stop it), and starting a different check stops the running one
first — before the new one is even constructed.

A switch is process-wide. It may target the engine that is still published
while a reconfigure is building the next one; every engine carrying the
running check (``register_engine``) gets the new one — or none, when the
switch is to off — so no engine is ever left holding a stopped check while
the process runs none.

Nothing here runs on the recall path. A recall reads the engine's judge once;
switching takes it off the engine before stopping it, so a recall that read
the old judge gets None from it, never an exception.
