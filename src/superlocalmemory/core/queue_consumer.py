"""Queue consumer — background loop that drains recall_queue.db.

Polls the recall queue for pending jobs, claims them atomically,
routes through pool.recall() (NEVER engine directly), and writes
results back. Runs as a daemon thread inside the SLM daemon process.

MEMORY SAFETY: This module must NEVER import MemoryEngine. All recall
goes through WorkerPool which manages the recall_worker subprocess.
The engine lives only in that subprocess — not in this process.
