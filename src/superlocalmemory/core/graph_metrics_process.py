"""The daemon's graph metrics, computed in a separate low-priority process.

WHY
---
PageRank and the Louvain partition over a whole store are pure-Python graph
work: on a copy of a 22k-fact store (480k edges) they held the interpreter for
seconds and set off garbage collections of 75-163 ms every few hundred
milliseconds. The daemon runs the pass shortly after every start that follows
new memories (``maintenance_scheduler._initial_graph_metrics``) and on its
maintenance cycle, and recalls that landed meanwhile took 5-9 s. Waiting for
"no recall in flight" would not help: a recall arriving mid-pass still waits.

WHAT THIS DOES
--------------
A spawned child process (``nice`` +10) opens the store read-only, reads the
graph and computes the rows with the same functions the in-process pass uses
(``graph_metrics.read_graph``, ``_networkx_metrics``, ``metrics_rows``), and
hands the rows back. The daemon writes them through the usual chunked writer
(``graph_metrics._write``): one writer, short transactions, the same rows. The
child never writes, so the store keeps a single writing process.

A child that fails or exceeds ``TIMEOUT_SECONDS`` is reported as an error (the
metrics stay as they were and the next cycle retries); it is never re-run on
the daemon's own interpreter, which is the stall this exists to remove.
