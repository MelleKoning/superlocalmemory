"""Run one pure computation in a spawned, low-priority child process.

For work that is all interpreter time -- decoding thousands of stored vectors,
graph algorithms over hundreds of thousands of edges. On the daemon's own
interpreter such work holds the interpreter lock in long stretches, and every
recall thread then waits up to the switch interval each time one of its
database reads hands the lock back (measured: 60 facts by id 15 -> 518 ms
beside one busy thread). A child process shares nothing with the recalls.

The function and its arguments must be importable and picklable; the child
starts fresh (``spawn``), so it never inherits the daemon's threads or locks.

The child never outlives the call: on a timeout or an error it is stopped
before this returns, and a child whose parent died (a killed daemon) exits on
its own within about a second. A process pool could not promise the first: its
shutdown cancels only work that has not started, so a timed-out computation ran
on to the end (up to 15 minutes) with nobody waiting for it.
