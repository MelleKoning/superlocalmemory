"""Background redrive for erase obligations.

The 30 s projection redrive used to treat every pending operation as an
ingestion. Erasure ids have no ingestion row by design, so their obligations
were failed as orphans and, after ten passes, reported as exhausted. This
module owns the erase side of that redrive.

An erase obligation is closed by proof, never by retrying: it becomes ERASED
only when the memory is gone from the canonical store, its tombstone exists,
and the owning projection holds nothing for it. Proof is read-only; nothing
here deletes or restores data. When proof fails the obligation is marked
FAILED with the reason, and once that has happened ``MAX_REPROOFS`` times the
erasure is reported by ``slm ops status`` instead of sitting silently. From
then on it is re-checked with a capped exponential back-off rather than every
pass, so a deletion that stays unconfirmed is not rewritten every 30 s forever.

Which memories an erasure covered comes from its erasure receipt: a fact
erasure names its one fact, an entity or profile erasure lists them in the
receipt's evidence. A receipt is trusted only after its seal verifies.
