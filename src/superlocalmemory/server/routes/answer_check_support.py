"""What the answer-check routes stand on: the saved settings, the running
check, and the status the dashboard reads.

* Settings are read from and written to one place (core/answer_check_state.py),
  so a route always reads what it wrote, whichever per-mode config file
  ``SLMConfig.load()`` happens to prefer.
* The running check is the judge on the published engine. After every change
  ``enforce()`` holds it to the saved settings: if a switch failed to take the
  hosted check (or its reordering) off, it is taken off here, and a route only
  answers success once that is true.
* ``build_status()`` only reads. It reports what actually runs (the live
  judge) rather than what the config would build, and never starts anything.
