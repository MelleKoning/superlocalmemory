"""The daemon's start-up recalls: they warm caches, and nobody asked them.

v3.4.62: the first user query used to take 15-24 s because it read the graph
tables from disk; v3.8.5: the first FULL recall paid an 8-13 s cold cost for the
ranking model and graph metrics. These recalls pay both at boot instead.

Each holds its own short ``operation_nowait()`` lease, so a profile switch
issued at daemon start is never blocked behind them; a pending transition
preempts the remaining ones (they complete on the next boot).

They are the system's own recalls, so they never ask the answer check: no
verdict, nothing sent to a hosted provider, nothing billed, and no memory
leaves the machine because the daemon started (``skip_answer_check()``). The
on-device check's model is warmed separately — locally, without a recall.
