"""A right-to-erasure request is not blocked by correction history.

Varun's decision (2026-10-07): "Erasure wins: erase the fact anyway, close its
correction cases as 'erased on request' and keep only a text-free audit row
(ids, when, who). The right to erasure isn't blocked by internal history."

The correction ledger (M042) refers to both facts of every case
``ON DELETE RESTRICT`` and never removes a case, so an ordinary delete of a fact
a person edited, or whose correction was applied, is refused (and still is:
core/correction_protection.py). A GDPR erasure is not an ordinary delete. Every
case naming an erased fact, whatever its status and whichever profile it is
filed under (the foreign key does not care), is closed here: one audit row with
ids, prior status, when and who, then its events and the case itself go, in
the same transaction that deletes the facts. So either the facts and their
cases go together, or nothing does and the erasure can simply be run again.

The audit row holds no memory text, like the ledger itself: the columns are
checked against M042's forbidden raw-text columns below. A case closed this way
cannot be put back: both its facts are gone.
