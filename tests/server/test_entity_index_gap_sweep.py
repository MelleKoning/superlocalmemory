"""Q7 (2026-10-06): the daemon's background gap sweep, end to end.

``run_entity_index_backfill`` still returns once the one-time backfill
completes -- an existing, tested contract
(``tests/test_retrieval/test_bridge_determinism.py::
TestTheBackfill::test_the_daemon_loop_publishes_progress_and_finishes``).
``run_entity_index_gap_sweep`` is the separate, never-terminal task chained
after it (see ``server/unified_daemon.py``'s
``_fact_entity_association_repair_loop``) that catches a coverage gap
introduced after the backfill already reported complete.
