"""The sufficiency judge must fail open, and must never strand itself.

The reranker taught both lessons the hard way: a worker that died stayed dead
for seven days because the code that re-warms it sat behind a readiness check,
and a recycle sent work to a worker still loading its model. Every test here
pins one way the judge could end up silent, stuck, or wrong — against a fake
worker that speaks the real protocol, so no model is ever loaded.
