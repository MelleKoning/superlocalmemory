"""Q9 explicit identity guard: shrinking the envelope must not touch the answer.

On ONE fixed synthetic store with a large (3,816-member) community,
``RetrievalEngine.recall()`` runs twice against the exact same db/channels —
once with ``build_community_context`` monkeypatched to reproduce the OLD,
pre-fix behaviour (the entire stored membership, no ``member_count`` /
``member_fact_ids_truncated``), once with the real, fixed function. The
``results`` the two runs return — same ids, same order, same scores, same
content — must be byte-for-byte identical; only ``community_context`` may
differ. Varun's condition: shrink the envelope "without degrading the
quality" — this is the test that says so explicitly, not an argument that it
follows from the diff.
