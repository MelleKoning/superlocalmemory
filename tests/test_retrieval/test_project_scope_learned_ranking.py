"""GitHub #150 with learned ranking switched on.

Learned ranking (``SLM_RANKING``) runs after retrieval and rewrites every
result's ranking score: the phase-2 heuristic from the displayed score, the
phase-3 model from its own features, the ensemble from bandit-weighted
channel scores. None of them knows the project, so a preference applied only
inside retrieval is undone by them - on exactly the stores that have
learning on. These tests run the issue's fixture under each mode, with a
seeded learning store (feedback rows, and for phase 3 a real LightGBM model
trained deterministically here), and check the project's memories still lead
and the order repeats.

    fixture's own retrieval features - rewarding the displayed score and
    keyword evidence - a plausible learned taste that knows nothing about
    projects, and that separates this fixture's memories.

    This used to train on an independent synthetic sample - x ~ uniform
    over a plausible-looking range (0.45-0.65 for the displayed score,
    0-5 for bm25, and so on) - rather than on values this fixture actually
    produces. That range is wide enough that the ten real values recall
    gives back for QUERY (a ~0.53-0.57 band - see the docstring on
    test_the_seeded_model_is_really_active for the measured numbers) are a
    handful of close points deep inside it. Histogram-based split-finding
    bins the training range into a fixed number of bins; whichever bin edges
    a platform's build happens to land on, nothing stops every one of those
    ten close points from landing in the SAME bin there even though they
    land in ten different leaves here - and when that happens every
    prediction for this fixture comes back identical. That is exactly what
    CI (ubuntu, Python 3.14) measured: every one of the ten scores in
    test_the_seeded_model_is_really_active came back 0.3636741782759984.

    Training directly on the rows this fixture's own (non-learning) recall
    produces - oversampled, each copy nudged by noise far smaller than the
    real gap between any two of them - puts all of the training mass inside
    the exact band being scored, so a split has to separate it wherever a
    platform's bin edges land, on every machine that runs this fixture.
