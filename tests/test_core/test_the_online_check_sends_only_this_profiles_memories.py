"""The online answer check never sends another profile's memories.

Consent to the online check is given once for the install, but a recall that
includes shared or global memories can return memories another profile owns —
in a team, memories another person wrote. Those must never leave the machine
on this profile's say-so. When the memories the online check would read
include one from another profile, the check is not asked for that recall: the
response says ``skipped``, and the results are exactly what retrieval returned.
The on-device check sends nothing anywhere, so it judges as before.
