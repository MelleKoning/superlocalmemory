"""A memory left with a delete tombstone and no delete finishing it is healed.

A delete writes the memory's erasure tombstone and removes its search entries
before the writer deletes it. If the writer times out (or the process dies) the
memory stays stored with the tombstone, unfindable. When correction history
protects it, every later delete is refused up front, so nothing would ever
finish that erasure: before 4.1.22 the memory stayed unfindable for good. Now
the refused delete rebuilds its search entries. An unprotected memory needs no
heal: the user's next delete completes the erasure (the user's intent).
