"""H2 (2026-10-06): ``remember_runtime.stop()`` can wait 5 s. Why, and bound it.

Root cause: ``DeferredCommitter._finish()`` calls ``mark_committed`` /
``mark_rejected`` / ``quarantine`` -- pure background bookkeeping stamps for
an entry whose underlying remember was *already* durably committed by
``self._commit()`` moments earlier -- with no deadline at all. The admission
journal's ``GroupCommitWriter._begin()`` treats "no deadline" as "wait the
full unbounded busy window" (``journal_writer._UNBOUNDED_BUSY_SECONDS``,
5 s) before giving up on ``BEGIN IMMEDIATE``. Since ``remember_runtime.stop()``
joins this worker thread (via ``DeferredCommitter.stop()``) before releasing
the writer lease, any journal-file contention at exactly the wrong moment
(very plausible right after a write burst, which is exactly when a stop is
also likely to be attempted) stalls the whole stop path for up to 5 real
seconds, once per retry.

The fix: these bookkeeping stamps now carry a short bounded deadline
(``_BOOKKEEPING_DEADLINE_SECONDS``, 2 s). Nothing about the user's data is at
risk from giving up early here -- the remember itself is already committed;
on a bookkeeping failure the entry simply stays "prepared"/"dispatched" and
is retried (by this same worker, with backoff) or, if the process stops
first, redone idempotently by ``replay_pending`` at the next start (the
coordinator dedupes by journal id, so a replayed stamp costs nothing).
