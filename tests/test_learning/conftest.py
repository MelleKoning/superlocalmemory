"""conftest for tests/test_learning/ — mocks LightGBM C training.

Unit tests in this directory test the LOGIC of the learning pipeline
(signal ingestion, feature extraction, retrain gating, shadow testing,
bandit loops) — NOT the LightGBM C extension itself.

Mocking strategy:
  - ``lightgbm.Dataset`` → MockDataset  (no C calls, no memory alloc)
  - ``lightgbm.train``   → mock_lgb_train (returns MockBooster instantly)

MockBooster.model_to_string() returns a REAL, loadable LightGBM model
string so that DB persistence + lgb.Booster(model_str=...) round-trips
still exercise the real code path, just with pre-computed weights.

Tests that need real LightGBM C training (e.g. benchmarks, CI perf
regression) belong in tests/test_integration/ and are excluded from
the fast unit test suite.
