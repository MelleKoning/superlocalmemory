"""A memory replaced while its enrichment is still running: the facts that
enrichment derives from it afterwards are retired as they are written, never
reach recall or session context, and come back when the replacement is undone.

This is the ordinary flow, not an edge case: an agent saves a checkpoint and
seconds later saves the update with ``replaces=<the id it was given>``, while
the checkpoint's background enrichment has not run yet."""
