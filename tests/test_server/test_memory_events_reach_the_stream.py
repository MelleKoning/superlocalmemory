"""Deleting or correcting a memory is announced once, from every surface.

The dashboard's live event stream offers "Memory deleted" and "Memory
corrected". Before 4.1.21 only the MCP ``delete_memory`` tool announced a
delete (a dashboard or CLI delete was silent), and no correction was announced
at all. The daemon's routes now announce both, so the dashboard, the CLI and
MCP are seen alike, and an MCP delete is announced once, not twice.
