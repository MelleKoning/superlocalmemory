"""Two facts tests need that Windows answers differently from POSIX.

* ``posix_bash()`` — a bash that really is a POSIX shell. On Windows a bare
  ``"bash"`` handed to ``subprocess`` resolves through CreateProcess, which
  searches ``System32`` before ``PATH`` and finds the WSL launcher there: on a
  machine with no Linux distribution it prints a UTF-16 "Windows Subsystem for
  Linux has no installed distributions" and runs nothing.
* ``committed_executable(path)`` — whether a shipped script carries the
  executable bit. Windows files have no such bit (``st_mode`` is always
  ``0o666``), so there the bit that ships is the one Git recorded (mode
  ``100755``), which is also what a package build reads.
